In this video, we're talking about building our scenario.
There are a lot of lessons in this exam course.
One of the easiest ways to remember is by adding context.
And to provide that context,
we created a fictional company called Ctrl Alt Sweets.
And there will be lessons
that describe this case study scenario,
so let me break it down for you.
